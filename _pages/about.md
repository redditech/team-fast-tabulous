Team Fan-tabulous was formed for the Queensland AI's Fast.ai course project. Our focus is on tabular data using the Homesite Competition data from Kaggle. We're made up of enthusiastic learners comprising
- Tim Cummings
- Tracy Dinh
- Jorge
- Nissan Dookeran
- Owen Powell
- Michael Senescall

We each will be contributing blog posts and notebooks as our individual learning journeys converge in producing our solution using FastAI and Deep Learning techniques we learn in our course.
